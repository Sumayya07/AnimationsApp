# UIKit Animation Project

This iOS UIKit Animation Project showcases various animations using the UIKit framework. The project integrates several types of view controllers including `NextViewController`, `NumberViewController`, `ConfirmViewController`, `PlayViewController`, and `CandyViewController`, each featuring distinct views and animations. From simple scale transitions to complex off-screen animations, this project covers a wide spectrum of UIKit capabilities, enriching the user interface elements and enhancing user engagement. The project is designed for extensibility, facilitating easy addition or modification of features.

## Features

- **NextViewController**: This controller uses `UIView.animate()` to transition multiple views from off-screen to their original positions upon view appearance.

- **NumberViewController**: This controller builds upon `NextViewController` by introducing label animations. Elements move from off-screen to their original position, creating a sense of dynamics.

- **ConfirmViewController**: This controller introduces text size animations in addition to off-screen animations. The font size of labels smoothly transitions from a smaller size to its original size.

- **PlayViewController**: It serves as the initial screen of the app, presenting two main views and two buttons. Upon loading, the corner radius properties are applied to the views and buttons, making them rounded.

- **CandyViewController**: This controller consists of multiple views, labels, and buttons. Various animations such as hiding and revealing of elements, and movement animations are utilized.

## Installation

Clone the repository and open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode. Run the project on a simulator or a physical device.

## Usage

Navigate through the app by interacting with the buttons on each screen. Enjoy the various animations as you move from one screen to another.
